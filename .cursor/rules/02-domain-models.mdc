# Domain Models

The core domain models define the business entities and rules for the Tusk application.

## Task Model

The [Task model](mdc:internal/core/task/model.go) is the primary entity representing user tasks with these key properties:

- Hierarchical structure with parent-child relationships
- Status tracking (todo, in-progress, done)
- Priority levels (low, medium, high)
- Due dates and completion status
- Progress calculation based on subtask completion

## User Model

The [User model](mdc:internal/core/user/model.go) manages authentication and user preferences.

## Error Handling

Domain-specific errors are defined in [internal/core/errors](mdc:internal/core/errors) to provide rich error context.
