# Database Integration

Tusk uses PostgreSQL with type-safe Go code generated by sqlc.

## Structure

- **Migrations**: Database schema in [db/migrations](mdc:db/migrations)
- **Generated Code**: Type-safe queries in [internal/adapters/db/sqlc](mdc:internal/adapters/db/sqlc)
- **Config**: Database configuration in [internal/config](mdc:internal/config)

## Connection Management

Database connections are managed in [internal/adapters/db](mdc:internal/adapters/db) with connections established at application startup in [cmd/cli/main.go](mdc:cmd/cli/main.go).

## Repository Pattern

Repositories implement the output ports defined in [internal/ports/output](mdc:internal/ports/output), providing a clean interface between the domain and database.
