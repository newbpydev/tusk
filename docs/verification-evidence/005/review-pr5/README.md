# PR #5 review remediation

### PR #5 hosted review R1 (2026-10-01)

Three stale-write UX findings are fixed with observed failing regressions:
paused form saves show an in-modal Ctrl+R hint; a paused delete supports r and
Ctrl+R, revokes old consent and loads a fresh preview; rejected toggles pause
writes until successful readback. Canonical `make validate build` passes.
Owned Kitty inspection at 100x32 confirms visible stale-form feedback and
retained raw draft. Delete-read abandonment and renewed consent are automated
regressions, not additional Kitty evidence. Receipts: `docs/verification-evidence/005/review-pr5/`.
Remaining hosted threads and Feature 006 native/release gates stay open.

### PR #5 hosted review R2 (2026-10-01)

Seven navigation/input/presentation findings have regression coverage and fixes:
paging counts task rows and group gaps with visible overlap; accepted search is
trimmed; collapse/projection share the end-inclusive predicate; search and filter
paste is atomically bounded and control-checked; picker windows start on titles
and retain the selected ID; details no longer render the form-template editor;
zero due dates display Not set in summary and recovery. Picker offset rounds up
to the next title, rather than down, so both selected lines remain visible at odd
heights. `make validate build` passes. Owned Kitty at 100x32 confirms whitespace
search acceptance, filter presentation and clean quit against an isolated DB.
The focused regression and Kitty receipts are under `review-pr5/`. Lifecycle and
portability review remains open; native/hosted release gates remain Feature 006.

### PR #5 hosted review R3 (2026-10-01)

Thirteen lifecycle, environment, dependency and verification findings are fixed.
Run rejects missing Open before terminal startup; the cold model waits for actual
terminal dimensions; SIGHUP follows graceful close and terminal restoration.
Display escaping covers invisible format controls while preserving ZWJ emoji.
The CLI and TUI use the same injected environment. Exact replacement pins now
carry maintenance guidance. Reachable dependency advisories are removed with
x/net 0.55.0, x/text 0.39.0, goldmark 1.7.17 and x/term 0.43.0.

Tests locate the source checkout independently of cwd, use the physical temporary
path and HOME/USERPROFILE, embed test-only tzdata, allow a five-second stress
watchdog and benchmark escaped JSON separately. The manual Kitty fixture is a
standalone, explicitly tagged binary, with no testing-runner os.Exit or weakened
coverage gate. The R2 screenshot was replaced with the inspected filter capture.

Observed Red/Green, final `make validate build check-generated bench-cli-json`,
minimum-Go focused race tests and five-target cross-builds pass. Owned Kitty
confirms the small-terminal banner, restored shell after SIGHUP and standalone
fixture quit. The current TUI matrix passes 78/78 cases plus startup. Its runtime
source matches; the subsequent Makefile-only change selects the escaped JSON
microbenchmark and does not affect the TUI binary or measurement.

`GOTOOLCHAIN=go1.25.13 make check-vulnerabilities` reports zero reachable or
imported-package vulnerabilities and one uncalled module advisory. The default
custom Go 1.27 compiler is unsupported by the installed source analyzer; its
failure is retained. Go 1.25.0 compatibility tests are not a security claim for
that old compiler. CLI acceptance remains open: first candidate 82/84,
unchanged earlier-commit control 80/84, quiet candidate 79/84. Every failed case
and raw sample is retained; no historical pass substitutes for current proof.
A patched-compiler comparison is underway. Hosted settlement and native/release
proof remain pending. Receipts: `docs/verification-evidence/005/review-pr5/`.
