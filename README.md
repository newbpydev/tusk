# Tusk: Your Tasks, Tamed with Go

A terminal-based task management application written in Go, designed for developers and power users who want a fast, extensible, and feature-rich TODO experience. Tusk combines PostgreSQL persistence, concurrent file backups, and a rich terminal UI to keep your workflow smooth, both now in CLI form and future REST/API extensions.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap & Project Timeline

This section outlines what‚Äôs been completed, what‚Äôs in progress, and upcoming milestones.

### ‚úÖ Completed

- **Scaffolding & Configuration** _(2025-04-23)_

  - Project structure with `cmd/`, `internal/`, `db/`, `migrations/`, and config.
  - GitHub repo initialized, `.env` support via `joho/godotenv`.
  - `.gitignore`, `.env.example`, and base README created.

- **Database Integration** _(2025-04-24)_

  - PostgreSQL schema defined with `users` and `tasks` tables, supporting recursive subtasks.
  - Migrations implemented using `golang-migrate` with triggers and constraints.
  - Type-safe DB layer generated via `sqlc`, using `pgx` and `pgtype`.
  - Smoke tests in `cmd/cli/main.go` for `CreateUser` and `CreateTask`.

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è In Progress

- **Step 3: Domain Models & Repository Layer**

  - Define Go structs for `User` and `Task`, including subtasks hierarchy and progress logic.
  - Implement repository wrappers that call the generated `sqlc` methods.
  - Auto-calculation of parent task completion based on subtasks.

### ‚è≥ Upcoming

- **Step 4: Service Layer & CLI Handlers**

  - Build service interfaces and business logic.
  - Wire CLI commands for `add`, `list`, `complete`, `delete`, and `reorder`.

- **Step 5: Terminal UI (TUI)**

  - Choose between `tview` or `tcell` for interactive Kanban and List views.
  - Keyboard navigation, highlighting, and toggling tasks.

- **Step 6: Kanban View & Advanced Features**

  - Group tasks by status in columns, enable drag-and-drop or key-based moves.
  - Persist column order and support custom sorting.

- **Step 7: User Authentication & Management**

  - Secure login prompt, session handling.
  - CLI commands for adding and removing users.

- **Step 8: File Backup & Concurrency**

  - Implement JSON/CSV backup that runs in parallel with DB writes via goroutines and channels.
  - Error handling and retry mechanisms.

- **Step 9: Testing & CI**

  - Unit tests for repository and service layers.
  - Integration tests with a test database.
  - GitHub Actions for automated testing and linting.

- **Step 10: REST API & Web App**

  - Expose the same business logic via a Go HTTP server.
  - Build a minimal web frontend (e.g. Next.js, SvelteKit) to consume the API.
